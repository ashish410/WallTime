#Permissions
Your privacy is very important. I only ask for the permissions that are essential for the app to be used properly.

- WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission to save the wallpapers to your own deviceâ€™s storage.

- READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission to read the saved wallpapers from your storage and also let you upload the image selected from your own gallery.
